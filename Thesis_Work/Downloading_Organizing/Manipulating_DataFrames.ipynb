    "Before downloading the data frame onto a device, it is important to ensure that the data frame will have a “target location.” This target location is a location on a device where it can be accessed as a downloaded file but also read in the Python virtual environment. Just because the file is downloaded onto the device that will be used for analysis does not mean it has been imported into the target location. Creating a target location is simple, but requires a little organization. Before starting any project, a repository can be made that contains all data frames, code, and additional information that will be relevant for a given project. The repository can be created in the form of a “folder” on the device being used for analysis and can contain subfolders for additional organization. \n",
